## General
- [ ] This is a prototype to be fleshed out into a production-grade application.
- [x] All new development should be containerized using Docker.

## Backend
- [x] The backend should be developed using Python.
- [x] Consider using a robust Python web framework (e.g., FastAPI, Django, or Flask).
- [ ] Employ a production-grade database (e.g., PostgreSQL) instead of SQLite for future development.
- [x] Follow RESTful API design principles.
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling and logging.
- [x] Write unit and integration tests for all backend components.

## Frontend
- [ ] The frontend should be developed using React and TypeScript.
- [ ] Utilize a modern state management library (e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand).
- [ ] Implement a component-based architecture.
- [ ] Ensure the UI is responsive and accessible.
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for all frontend components.

## Infrastructure
- [x] Continue using Docker and Docker Compose for local development and deployment.
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting for production environments.

## Code Style
- [x] Follow consistent code style guidelines for Python (e.g., PEP 8).
- [ ] Follow consistent code style guidelines for TypeScript/JavaScript (e.g., Prettier, ESLint).
- [x] Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.
