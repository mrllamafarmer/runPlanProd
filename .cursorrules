## General
- [x] This is a prototype to be fleshed out into a production-grade application.
- [x] All new development should be containerized using Docker.

## Docker Development Notes
- **Frontend changes may require complete rebuild**: Due to Docker caching issues with multi-stage builds, frontend changes may not take effect with normal `docker-compose build` or `docker-compose restart`. 
- **Use complete rebuild command**: When frontend changes don't appear after normal rebuild, use: `docker compose down --rmi all && docker compose up -d --build`
- **This ensures**: All images are removed and rebuilt from scratch, bypassing Docker's aggressive caching.

## Backend âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] The backend should be developed using Python.
- [x] Consider using a robust Python web framework (e.g., FastAPI, Django, or Flask).
- [x] Employ a production-grade database (e.g., PostgreSQL) instead of SQLite for future development.
- [x] Follow RESTful API design principles.
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling and logging.
- [x] Write unit and integration tests for all backend components.
- [x] Implement JWT-based authentication and user management.
- [x] Add structured logging with rotation and monitoring.
- [x] Achieve 95% test coverage with comprehensive test suite.
- [x] Implement PostgreSQL schema with proper relationships.
- [x] Add health checks and monitoring endpoints.
- [x] Maintain API compatibility during migration.

## Frontend ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] The frontend should be developed using React and TypeScript.
- [ ] Utilize a modern state management library (e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand).
- [ ] Implement a component-based architecture.
- [ ] Ensure the UI is responsive and accessible.
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for all frontend components.
- [ ] Implement route visualization with interactive maps and elevation charts.
- [x] Set up React project structure with TypeScript and modern tooling.
- [ ] Migrate vanilla JavaScript GPX analyzer to React components.
- [ ] Implement state management with Zustand.
- [ ] Migrate map visualization from vanilla Leaflet to react-leaflet.
- [ ] Migrate charts from Chart.js to React-based charting.
- [ ] Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.

## Infrastructure
- [x] Continue using Docker and Docker Compose for local development and deployment.
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL with proper Docker integration.
- [x] Implement health checks for all services.
- [x] Fix Docker health check compatibility issues.
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting for production environments.
- [ ] Set up automated database migrations.
- [ ] Configure production environment variables and secrets.

## Code Style
- [x] Follow consistent code style guidelines for Python (e.g., PEP 8).
- [ ] Follow consistent code style guidelines for TypeScript/JavaScript (e.g., Prettier, ESLint).
- [x] Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.
- [x] Implement comprehensive docstrings and type hints.
- [x] Follow proper exception handling patterns.

## Security & Authentication âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Implement JWT-based authentication system.
- [x] Add user registration and login functionality.
- [x] Implement password hashing with PBKDF2.
- [x] Add route access control (private/public routes).
- [x] Implement proper session management.
- [x] Add input validation and sanitization.

## Testing & Quality Assurance âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Achieve 95% code coverage for backend.
- [x] Write unit tests for all database operations.
- [x] Write integration tests for API endpoints.
- [x] Write tests for authentication and authorization.
- [x] Set up pytest with proper configuration.
- [x] Generate HTML coverage reports.
- [ ] Set up frontend testing framework.
- [ ] Write component tests for React components.
- [ ] Set up end-to-end testing.

## Database & Data Management âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL.
- [x] Design proper database schema for multi-user support.
- [x] Implement user management with relationships.
- [x] Add proper indexes for performance.
- [x] Implement database connection pooling.
- [x] Add database health checks.
- [x] Create database migration scripts.
